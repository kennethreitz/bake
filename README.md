# `bashf`: Kinda like Make & Bash, combined.

I love using `Makefile`s for one-off tasks in projects. The problem with doing this, is you can't use familiar bash–isms when doing so, as GNU Make doesn't use the familiar Bash sytnax. This project seeks to bridge these works.

## Installation

Install `bashf` via:

    $ brew install kennethreitz/-/bashf --head
